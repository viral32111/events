# Example Mod

I find it frustrating that [Minecraft mixins](https://github.com/SpongePowered/Mixin/wiki/Mixins-on-Minecraft-Forge) are not documented enough, and I am fed up with constantly searching through mapped Minecraft sources for the right function. Thus, this project serves as a place for me to document and demonstrate how to use the mixins I come across while developing my Fabric mods.

The mixins in this repository are accurate as of release `1.19.4`. Feel free to submit [pull requests](https://github.com/viral32111/example-mod/pulls) to keep this project up-to-date if mixins break or to document new ones.

See the [Gradle properties](/gradle.properties) and [Fabric mod metadata](/src/main/resources/fabric.mod.json) files for the versions this mod was last built against.
